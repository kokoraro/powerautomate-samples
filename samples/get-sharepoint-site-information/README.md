## Minimal Path to Awesome

* [Download](solution/get-sharepoint-site-information.zip) the `.zip` from the `solution` folder
* [Import](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/import-export-bap-packages/) the `.zip` file using **My Flows** > **Import** > **Upload** within Microsoft Flow.
* After downloading and importing the flow, proceed to open the flow and expand the **Compose** action named **'Settings'** and replace the **siteUrl** property with your own siteUrl.

## Using the Source Code

You can also use the [Power Apps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli) to pack the source code by following these steps::

* Clone the repository to a local drive
* Pack the source files back into a solution `.zip` file:
  ```bash
  pac solution pack --zipfile pathtodestinationfile --folder pathtosourcefolder --processCanvasApps
  ```
  Making sure to replace `pathtosourcefolder` to point to the path to this sample's `sourcecode` folder, and `pathtodestinationfile` to point to the path of this solution's `.zip` file (located under the `solution` folder)
* Within **Power Automate Studio**, import the solution `.zip` file using **Solutions** > **Import Solution** and select the `.zip` file you just packed.
